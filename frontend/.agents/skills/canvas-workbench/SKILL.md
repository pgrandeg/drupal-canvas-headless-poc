description:
  Use when work must be verified in local Canvas Workbench, or when the user
  asks to run, open, check, or author component mocks or page previews in
  Workbench. Verifies that Canvas Workbench is available through the project's
  package runner, starts the local Workbench dev server, and keeps Workbench
  verification as part of the implementation workflow.

## Project type

Before applying this skill, check `package.json` for a dependency named
`@drupal-canvas/headless` or starting with `@drupal-canvas/headless-`. If one is
present, this is a Canvas Headless codebase — read
[`canvas-headless`](../canvas-headless/SKILL.md) first. Workbench currently
supports React projects only: use it in React headless projects (Next.js,
TanStack Start), but in Nuxt and Astro projects verify components through the
framework dev server instead. If no such dependency is present, this is a
Canvas-rendered React codebase: components are React (`index.jsx`/`.tsx`) and
everything in this skill applies as written. These are the only two project
types.

## Installation gate

Before trying to use Workbench, detect the project's package manager and use its
executable runner for `@drupal-canvas/workbench`.

Preferred commands:

- npm: `npx @drupal-canvas/workbench`
- pnpm: `pnpm dlx @drupal-canvas/workbench`
- bun: `bunx @drupal-canvas/workbench`
- yarn: `yarn dlx @drupal-canvas/workbench`

Choose the command that matches the repository's package manager. Use lockfiles
and existing project conventions to decide.

If the package runner or `@drupal-canvas/workbench` is not available, stop and
tell the user that Canvas Workbench is not available in the current environment.
Ask whether they want you to install it. If they say yes, install
`@drupal-canvas/workbench` as a dev dependency with the matching package
manager:

- npm: `npm install --save-dev @drupal-canvas/workbench`
- pnpm: `pnpm add --save-dev @drupal-canvas/workbench`
- bun: `bun add --dev @drupal-canvas/workbench`
- yarn: `yarn add --dev @drupal-canvas/workbench`

After installation completes, use the matching runner command and continue with
Workbench verification. If the user says no, stop and do not guess alternate
startup commands.

## Configuration gate

Workbench does not require a `canvas.config.json` file when the project uses the
default Canvas layout.

Before starting Workbench, check whether the project appears to use the default
paths:

- `componentDir`: project root
- `pagesDir`: `./pages`
- `aliasBaseDir`: `src`
- `globalCssPath`: `./src/components/global.css`

If the project uses those defaults and `canvas.config.json` is missing, proceed
without creating one.

If the project uses different component paths, pages paths, `@/` import
resolution, or global CSS entrypoints, add or update `canvas.config.json` in the
project root before starting Workbench. Set only the options the project needs.

Example:

```json
{
  "componentDir": "./src/components",
  "pagesDir": "./pages",
  "aliasBaseDir": "src",
  "globalCssPath": "./src/global.css"
}
```

## Start Workbench

When Workbench verification is needed and the package-runner command is
available:

1. Run the matching Workbench command from the project root.
2. Treat it as a long-running local dev server process.
3. Read the startup output and use the local URL it prints.
4. Leave the server running while you verify the result.

If a Workbench server is already running for the current project, reuse it
instead of starting a second instance.

## Page, site, and client context

Both interactive previews and `preview-build` output supply the providers for
`usePageContext()`, `useSiteContext()`, and `useJsonApiClient()` automatically.
Do not add component-level providers or inject Drupal globals to make these
hooks work. Site data and client configuration come from the Vite integration's
public `/canvas/api/v0/site-data` request, with existing configuration
fallbacks.

Workbench does not load the current Drupal page's context. Its intentional page
defaults are:

```js
{ pageTitle: '', breadcrumbs: [], mainEntity: null }
```

An empty breadcrumb trail or hidden entity-dependent component may therefore be
correct. Verify real page context in Drupal or the routed headless application;
do not invent JSON:API payloads or page-context fixtures in component mocks to
conceal these defaults. Keep using real loading, empty, and error states.

Edits to an existing mock refresh the mounted preview in place and preserve
component state. Adding/removing discovery files can remount the iframe. When
checking initial state, explicitly reload rather than assuming a mock edit reset
it.

## Verification workflow

Workbench is the runtime surface for local preview verification. When
verification is iterative, reuse the same Workbench server and preview route
across fix/review loops.

Use Workbench as part of the normal implementation loop:

1. Start or reuse Workbench.
2. Open the relevant component preview state or page preview.
3. Verify that the requested change renders correctly.
4. If the result is wrong, update the implementation and verify again.
5. Finish only after Workbench verification passes, or explain clearly what
   blocked verification.

## Scope

This skill is for starting and using Workbench and for coordinating page/mock
authoring. It is not the source of truth for the Canvas component contract.

- Use `canvas-component-definition` when creating or validating the component
  structure, `component.yml`, naming, or mock coverage expectations.
- Use `canvas-page-definition` when creating or validating page JSON files, page
  structure, or page schema requirements.
- Use `canvas-component-definition/references/component-mocks.md` when you need
  to author or validate `mocks.json`.
- Use `references/components.md` when you need the Workbench-specific component
  review flow and where component preview files live.
- Use `references/pages.md` when you need the Workbench-specific page preview
  flow and configured page location.
